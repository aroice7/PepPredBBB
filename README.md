# PepPredBBB
A machine learning model that classifies a peptide by its ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier, utilizing a unique cheminformatics- and NLP-driven feature extraction process. 
Chemical fingerprint and word2vec sequence embedding to categorize a peptide as blood-brain-barrier penetrating or non-blood-brain-barrier penetrating. 
Identifies more effective peptide targets for neurodegenerative disease drug development, accelerating the design process for new treatments.
Data from the Stanford Xia Lab, BBPPred Dataset.
